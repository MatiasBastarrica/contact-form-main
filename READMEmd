## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned to show a success message when the form is submitted correctly and to show error messages when an input is not valid. I also learned to customize the style of the radio inputs as well as the checkmark input.

### Continued development

In the future I'd like to continue working with form validation
